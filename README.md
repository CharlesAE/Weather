![Weather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharlesAE/Weather/master/Screenshot01.jpg "Currently the UI of the app")

A Simple Android application to check the weather in the USA.

App utilizes:
- the WUnderground api (for documentation see http://api.wunderground.com/api/)
- the Picasso Open Source image downloading and caching library (for documentation see http://square.github.io/picasso/)
- XmlPullParser to parse the WUndergrounds api which is in xml format (also available in JSON), ive demonstrated how to handle nested xml tags, which ive noticed quite a few people had trouble figuring out on Stackoverflow (for XMLPullParser documentation see http://developer.android.com/reference/org/xmlpull/v1/XmlPullParser.html
- Screenshot is how app the currently looks as of Feb/19/2016. (I've made quite a few changes to both UI and code as i may release it to the play store when completed). The uploaded version is much more basic
